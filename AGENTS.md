# Project Instructions for Codex

## Project Overview

**OpenTabs Platform** is a Chrome extension + MCP server with a plugin-based architecture. A plugin SDK allows anyone to create OpenTabs plugins as standalone npm packages. The MCP server discovers plugins at runtime, and the Chrome extension dynamically injects plugin adapters into matching tabs — giving AI agents access to web applications through the user's authenticated browser session.

```

**MCP Server** (`platform/mcp-server`): Plugin discovery, tool dispatch via WebSocket, browser tools, audit log. See `platform/mcp-server/AGENTS.md` for details.

**Chrome Extension** (`platform/browser-extension`): Adapter injection, tool dispatch relay, React side panel UI. Published to npm as `@opentabs-dev/browser-extension` and bundled as a CLI dependency so `opentabs start` can auto-install it. See `platform/browser-extension/AGENTS.md` for details.

**Plugin SDK** (`platform/plugin-sdk`): `OpenTabsPlugin` base class, `defineTool` factory, SDK utilities, structured errors. See `platform/plugin-sdk/AGENTS.md` for details.

**Plugin Tools** (`platform/plugin-tools`): Plugin developer CLI (`opentabs-plugin build`). See `platform/plugin-tools/AGENTS.md` for details.

**CLI** (`platform/cli`): User-facing CLI (`opentabs`). See `platform/cli/AGENTS.md` for details.

**create-plugin** (`platform/create-plugin`): Scaffolding CLI (`npx @opentabs-dev/create-plugin`) for new plugin projects.

### You Are Connected to This Project's MCP Server

The OpenTabs MCP server you are developing is also the MCP server you are connected to. Your MCP tool list includes OpenTabs tools (browser tools, plugin tools like `slack_*` and `discord_*`, extension diagnostics) — these are the live tools served by the running dev server. Use them freely:

- **`extension_get_state`**, **`extension_get_logs`**: Inspect the Chrome extension's live state and logs — useful for debugging extension behavior, WebSocket connectivity, adapter injection, and tab state.
- **`browser_*` tools**: Interact with the user's browser tabs (screenshot, click, type, read content, network capture, etc.).
- **Plugin tools** (`slack_*`, `discord_*`, etc.): Call live plugin tools in authenticated browser tabs.
- **`plugin_list_tabs`**: Discover which tabs are open and ready for each plugin.
- **`extension_reload`**: Reload the Chrome extension after building.
- **`extension_check_adapter`**: Diagnose adapter injection issues for a specific plugin.

When the user says "reload the extension", "check the side panel", "send a Slack message", or "screenshot Discord" — they expect you to use these MCP tools directly. You are both the developer and a live consumer of this platform.

### Workflow Skills

Each subdirectory has its own `AGENTS.md` with package-specific details.

### Key Concepts

**Tool name prefixing**: Plugin tools are exposed to MCP clients with a `<plugin>_<name>` prefix (e.g., `slack_send_message`). This prevents name collisions across plugins.

**Tab state machine**: Each plugin has three tab states: `closed`, `unavailable`, and `ready`. The extension reports all matching tabs per plugin (with per-tab readiness) to the MCP server via `tab.syncAll` and `tab.stateChanged`.

**Multi-tab targeting**: When multiple tabs match a plugin, AI agents can target a specific tab by passing an optional `tabId` parameter to any plugin tool. The platform injects `tabId` into every plugin tool's input schema automatically — plugin authors never see it. Use `plugin_list_tabs` to discover available tabs and their IDs before targeting. Without `tabId`, the platform auto-selects the best-ranked tab (existing behavior).

**Authentication and secrets**: The WebSocket secret is stored in `~/.opentabs/extension/auth.json` as `{ "secret": "<hex>" }`. This is the single source of truth — `config.json` does not store the secret.

**Plugin discovery**: npm auto-discovery + local plugins from `~/.opentabs/config.json`. Four-phase pipeline: resolve npm → resolve local → load all → merge (local overrides npm) → build immutable registry. See `platform/mcp-server/AGENTS.md` for details.

**Permission model**: Every tool has a 3-state permission: `'off'` (disabled, returns error), `'ask'` (requires human approval via dialog), or `'auto'` (executes immediately). Permissions are configured per-plugin and per-tool in `~/.opentabs/config.json` under the `permissions` map. Resolution order: `skipPermissions` (`OPENTABS_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS` env var) → per-tool override → plugin default → `'off'`.

**Lifecycle hooks**: `onActivate`, `onDeactivate`, `onNavigate`, `onToolInvocationStart`, `onToolInvocationEnd`. See `platform/plugin-sdk/AGENTS.md` for details.

**Progress reporting**: Tools report progress via `ToolHandlerContext.reportProgress()`. See `platform/mcp-server/AGENTS.md` for the full dispatch pipeline.

**Plugin review system**: Plugins start with permission `'off'` and must be reviewed before use. When an agent calls a tool on an unreviewed plugin, the error response guides it through a review flow: call `plugin_inspect` to retrieve the adapter IIFE source code and a review token → AI reviews the code with security guidance → user confirms → call `plugin_mark_reviewed` with the token to set the permission and mark the plugin as reviewed. Review state is tracked per-version via `reviewedVersion` in `PluginPermissionConfig` — when a plugin updates, its permission resets to `'off'` and requires re-review. The side panel shows an unreviewed icon (shield with question mark) on plugin cards and presents a confirmation dialog when users try to enable unreviewed plugins directly. Both `plugin_inspect` and `plugin_mark_reviewed` are platform tools (always available, bypass permissions, hidden from the side panel). See `platform/mcp-server/AGENTS.md` for server-side details and `platform/browser-extension/AGENTS.md` for UI details.

**Plugin settings**: Plugins declare a `configSchema` (typed field definitions with labels, types, and validation) in their SDK class and `package.json`. Users provide values in `config.json` under a `settings` map keyed by short plugin name. At load time, `url`-type settings derive Chrome match patterns and `homepage` automatically — enabling plugins that work across user-specific instances without hardcoded URL patterns. Resolved settings are injected into the MAIN world before the adapter IIFE runs (via `globalThis.__openTabs.pluginConfig`) and are accessible to tool handlers via `getConfig(key)` from the plugin SDK. Three user surfaces exist for configuring settings: CLI interactive (`opentabs plugin configure <name>`), CLI scripted (`opentabs config set setting.<plugin>.<key> <value>`), and side panel UI (ConfigDialog with NeedsSetup badge when required fields are unset). See `platform/plugin-sdk/AGENTS.md` and `platform/mcp-server/AGENTS.md` for details.

### Commands

```bash
# Build
npm run build           # Build all packages (incremental tsc --build + extension bundle + icons)
npm run build:force     # Full clean rebuild (tsc --build --force + extension bundle + icons)
npm run build:plugins   # Build all plugins (install + build each)
npm run build:docs      # Build docs site (next build)

# Dev
npm run dev             # Full dev mode (tsc watch + MCP server + extension, colored output with startup banner)
npm run dev:mcp         # MCP server only with hot reload (lightweight alternative to full dev)
npm run dev:docs        # Docs dev server (next dev)

# Quality checks
npm run check           # Root checks: build + build:plugins + lint + format:check + knip + test
npm run check:everything # Everything: root checks + E2E + docs + plugins
npm run check:docs      # Docs checks (delegates to docs/package.json check script)
npm run check:plugins   # Plugin checks: type-check + lint + format:check (all plugins)
npm run type-check      # TypeScript check (tsc --build, incremental verification)

npm run format          # Biome format
npm run format:check    # Biome format check
npm run knip            # Unused code detection

# Docs (from root)
npm run lint:docs       # Biome lint docs
npm run type-check:docs # TypeScript check docs

# Test
npm run test            # Unit tests (Vitest)
npm run test:e2e        # E2E tests (Playwright)

# Clean
npm run clean           # Remove build artifacts (dist/, tsbuildinfo, generated icons)
npm run clean:all       # clean + remove node_modules across all workspaces and plugins

# UI
npm run storybook       # Launch Storybook dev server (browser extension components)

# Setup
npm install             # Install dependencies
```

The `npm run` commands above are for **platform contributors** working in the monorepo. Normal users interact via the `opentabs` CLI, and plugin developers use `npm run build` / `opentabs plugin create` (or `npx @opentabs-dev/create-plugin` for those without the CLI installed globally).

### Loading the Extension

1. `npm run build`
2. Open `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Load unpacked → select `~/.opentabs/extension` folder

### Reloading the Extension After Code Changes

The Chrome extension does NOT auto-reload. After building (`npm run build`), the extension must be manually reloaded:

1. `npm run build`
2. Open `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click the refresh icon on the "OpenTabs" card
4. Close and reopen the side panel if it was open

Plugin adapter changes are picked up via `POST /reload` (triggered by `opentabs-plugin build`) without extension reload.

### Starting the MCP Server

**Production mode** (default):

```bash
opentabs start
```

**Dev mode** — MCP server only, with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev:mcp
```

**Full dev mode** — tsc watch + MCP server + extension build, with colored output and startup banner:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Development Workflow

All development workflows below assume the MCP server is running in dev mode. Use `npm run dev` for full dev mode (tsc watch + MCP server + extension) or `npm run dev:mcp` for server-only work with hot reload. In production mode, restart the server after any changes.

### MCP Server Changes (Hot Reload)

```bash
# 1. Edit source files in platform/mcp-server/src/
# 2. Build
cd platform/mcp-server && npm run build
# 3. Done — the dev proxy detects the change and restarts the worker
```

### Chrome Extension Changes

```bash
# 1. Edit source files in platform/browser-extension/src/
# 2. Build
npm run build
# 3. Reload extension from chrome://extensions/
```

### Plugin Changes

```bash
# 1. Edit plugin source
# 2. Build the plugin
cd plugins/<name> && npm run build
# 3. Done — build notifies the server via POST /reload
```

---

## Pulling Latest Changes

At the start of every session, pull the latest changes before doing any work:

```bash
git pull
```

This repository is configured with `pull.rebase = true`, so `git pull` automatically rebases local commits on top of the remote. If the pull fails due to conflicts, resolve them before proceeding.

### Webhook Auto-Pull and Build

A local webhook server (`~/.opentabs/webhook/`) automatically pulls and builds the repository when code is pushed to `main`. The server uses [adnanh/webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook) on port 9000, exposed to GitHub via a Cloudflare Tunnel. On each push to `main`, the webhook validates the HMAC-SHA256 signature, runs `git pull --rebase origin main`, and then runs `npm run build`. The webhook is registered as a launchd service (`dev.opentabs.webhook`) that starts on login.

The pull is skipped if the local branch is not `main` or the working tree is dirty. Build output is logged to `~/.opentabs/webhook/pull.log`.

Key files:

| File                             | Purpose                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.opentabs/webhook/hooks.json` | Hook definitions (routes, HMAC validation, trigger rules)   |
| `~/.opentabs/webhook/pull.sh`    | Execution script: pull + build                              |
| `~/.opentabs/webhook/start.sh`   | Startup: launches webhook + tunnel + registers GitHub hooks |
| `~/.opentabs/webhook/ctl.sh`     | Control script (`start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status`/`logs`)   |

### Ralph Infrastructure on Remote Server (`ssh pc`)

A remote Linux server (`ssh pc`) runs two systemd services that automate branch merging and parallel task execution:

**Ralph Consumer** (`ralph-consumer.service`): A daemon that picks up PRD (product requirement document) files from a queue and dispatches them to AI workers. Each worker runs Codex in a dedicated worktree to execute the PRD's user stories. Workers push completed work to `ralph-*` branches on the remote.

**Ralph Consolidator** (`ralph-consolidator.service`): A daemon that polls for `ralph-*` branches, merges them into `main`, runs the build + tests, and pushes. If the merge produces build failures, it invokes Codex to fix them automatically. If a push is rejected (non-fast-forward), it rebases and retries up to 3 times.

Key paths on the remote:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.ralph-consumer/` | Consumer state: `queue/`, `worktrees/`, `logs/`, config |
| `~/.ralph-consolidator/` | Consolidator state: `code/` (work repo), `logs/`, `conflicts/` |

Service management:

```bash
ssh pc "sudo systemctl stop ralph-consolidator"     # Stop the consolidator
ssh pc "sudo systemctl start ralph-consolidator"    # Start the consolidator
ssh pc "sudo systemctl stop ralph-consumer"         # Stop the consumer
ssh pc "sudo systemctl start ralph-consumer"        # Start the consumer
ssh pc "systemctl is-active ralph-consolidator"     # Check status
ssh pc "tail -30 ~/.ralph-consolidator/logs/latest.log"  # View consolidator logs
ssh pc "tail -30 ~/.ralph-consumer/logs/latest.log"      # View consumer logs
```

**When to stop the consolidator**: If you need to push multiple commits to `main` without the consolidator racing you, stop it first (`sudo systemctl stop ralph-consolidator`), push your changes, then restart it. The consolidator rebases and retries, but if you're pushing frequently it can get stuck in a rebase-retry loop.

**When to check logs**: If expected branch merges aren't appearing on `main`, check the consolidator logs. Common issues: push race conditions (non-fast-forward), build failures after merge (SDK changes breaking plugins), and plugin dependency mismatches after rebasing.

---

## Git Identity

Before making any commits, verify the git identity is configured correctly:

```
git config user.name   # Must be: Ralph Wiggum
git config user.email  # Must be: ralph@opentabs.dev
```

If either value is wrong, fix it before committing:

```bash
git config user.name "Ralph Wiggum"
git config user.email "ralph@opentabs.dev"
```

---

## Committing and Pushing

### Pre-Commit Review

When the user asks to commit, **review every changed line before staging.** This is the last gate before code enters the repository — treat it as a code review, not a formality.

- **Read the full diff** (`git diff` for unstaged, `git diff --cached` for staged). Do not commit changes you have not re-read.
- **Verify the code meets the highest standard.** No workarounds. No monkey patches. No "good enough for now." Every function must be clean, well-named, and correctly abstracted. If a change is a hack that papers over a bug rather than fixing the root cause, stop and fix it properly before committing.
- **Verify no dead code, debug artifacts, or commented-out lines** made it in.
- **Verify the change is complete.** All call sites updated, all types correct, all tests passing, all related files consistent. A partial change is worse than no change.
- **If anything looks wrong, fix it first.** Do not commit with a mental note to "clean up later." Later never comes.

### Push Protocol

When asked to commit and push, always pull first to rebase on the latest remote before pushing. The pre-push hook runs the full build and test suite, so pushes can take a few minutes.

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"
git pull              # rebases local commits on top of remote
git push
```

If `git push` is rejected because the remote has new commits, `git pull` and then `git push` again.

### Lockfile Auto-Staging

The pre-commit hook auto-stages any dirty `package-lock.json` file whose sibling `package.json` is being committed. This prevents lockfile drift caused by `npm install` or build side effects. You do not need to manually `git add` lockfiles when their sibling `package.json` is already staged — the hook handles it.

**Always commit dirty lockfiles.** After builds, `npm install`, or pre-push hooks (which rebuild all plugins), `package-lock.json` files across plugins may be modified. These lockfile changes must always be committed — never leave them as unstaged changes in the working tree. If lockfiles are dirty after a push (because the pre-push hook rebuilt plugins), commit them immediately in a follow-up commit. Lockfile drift left uncommitted causes noise in future diffs and can lead to inconsistent dependency resolution.

### Concurrent AI Work

Multiple AI agents (ralph workers, perfect scripts, other Codex sessions) may be running simultaneously. Unstaged changes in the working directory may belong to another agent's in-progress work.

**Never discard, reset, or checkout over unstaged changes without explicit user permission.** If unstaged changes block an operation (e.g., `git pull` refuses to rebase), ask the user how to proceed — do not run `git checkout -- .`, `git restore .`, or `git reset --hard`. The correct default is to stash (`git stash`) and remind the user to pop it later, but even stashing should be confirmed first when the changes look like they belong to another process.

---

## Code Quality Rules

### Core Principles

You are the best frontend React engineer, the best UI/UX designer, and the best software architect. Hold yourself to the highest standard — no lazy work, no half-measures, no excuses. Every line of code you write should reflect that standard.

**Honesty over agreement. Always.** Never default to agreeing with the user. If the user's approach, assumption, or design is wrong, say so directly and explain why. Do not compliment ideas that are mediocre. Do not validate decisions that are incorrect. Provide the honest, technically accurate answer — even when it contradicts what the user believes or wants to hear. Correct mistakes clearly and respectfully. The only exception is when the user explicitly insists on their approach after being informed of the tradeoffs.

**Correctness over speed. Always.** Never be lazy. Never take the easy path when the correct path exists. Always use the correct method and best practice, even if it takes more time. Doing the right thing and keeping code clean is the highest priority — never compromise on this.

- **Think deeply before proposing solutions** - when facing a design problem, do not jump to the first working approach. Step back, understand the full architecture, identify all constraints (CSP, runtime context, injection model, etc.), and reason from first principles to find the _correct_ solution. A quick fix that works is not the same as the right design. If the platform already solves an analogous problem (e.g., file-based injection bypasses CSP), the new solution should use the same proven pattern — not invent a weaker workaround. Propose one well-thought-out design, not a sequence of increasingly less-bad ideas.
- **Never cut corners** - if the correct approach requires more code, more refactoring, or more time, that is the right approach. Shortcuts create debt that compounds.
- **Always use the right abstraction** - do not inline logic that belongs in a helper, do not duplicate code that should be shared, do not stuff unrelated concerns into the same function. Use the correct pattern for the problem.
- **Do the full job** - when fixing something, fix it completely. Update all call sites. Update all tests. Update all types. Update all documentation. Do not leave partial work.
- **Read before writing** - before changing any code, read and understand the surrounding context, existing patterns, and conventions. Match them. Do not introduce a new pattern when an established one exists.
- **Check git history before reverting or "fixing" recent changes** - when something is broken, always run `git log` to understand _why_ the current code looks the way it does. If a recent commit introduced a change (e.g., renaming, restructuring, new convention), assume the change was intentional and fix the downstream code to match — do not revert the change. Reverting intentional work is destructive and lazy. The correct response to "tests broke after a rename" is to update the tests, not to undo the rename.
- **Think before acting** - step back and consider the broader design before making changes. Ask: "Is this the right place for this code? Is this the right level of abstraction? Will this be clear to the next person reading it?"
- **Decide component boundaries before coding** - when building UI, determine which component owns which state and which DOM elements before writing any JSX. If controls must appear on the same row, they must live in the same component's render output. Do not split a visual unit across component boundaries and then try to patch it back together with props, slots, or wrappers. If the first attempt creates a layout problem, do not patch the symptom — redesign the boundary.
- **Never iterate in circles** - if a fix introduces a new problem, stop. Do not apply another incremental patch. Instead, re-examine the root cause and identify the correct architectural solution. Two failed attempts at the same problem means the approach is wrong, not that it needs more tweaking.
- **Search for existing solutions before inventing your own** - when facing an unfamiliar problem (runtime behavior, library quirk, platform limitation), search online for similar issues before guessing at a fix. Check official documentation, GitHub issues, and community forums (Stack Overflow, etc.) for known solutions and workarounds. The correct fix is often already documented — inventing a workaround without researching first wastes time and risks introducing a worse solution than the established one.
- **No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments** - if something needs to be done, do it now. Do not leave markers for future work as an excuse to ship incomplete code.
- **Naming matters** - spend time choosing precise, descriptive names for variables, functions, types, and files. A good name eliminates the need for a comment.
- **Delete fearlessly** - if code is unused, remove it. If a file is obsolete, delete it. Dead code is noise that obscures intent.
- **Own the codebase** - if tests, lint, or build are failing when you start a session, fix them. Do not treat pre-existing failures as someone else's problem. If the codebase is broken, it is your responsibility to make it whole before moving on. You are not a guest — you are the engineer on duty.
- **Break freely, refactor fully** - this is an internal, self-contained tool with no external consumers. Never let backwards compatibility concerns hold back the correct design. If a change introduces breaking changes, refactor all affected call sites, tests, and types in the same change. There is no excuse for keeping a worse API or pattern alive just to avoid updating callers you fully control.

### Engineering Standards

- **Write modular, clean code** - never write hacky code
- **Step back before fixing** - when fixing bugs, always consider if there's a cleaner architectural solution rather than patching symptoms
- **Prefer refactoring over quick fixes** - if a fix requires hacky code, that's a signal the underlying design needs improvement
- **Component design** - keep components focused, reusable, and well-separated
- **User experience first** - every UI decision should prioritize clarity and usability
- **Clean up unused code** - always remove dead code, unused imports, outdated comments, and obsolete files; keep the codebase lean with only what is needed

### TypeScript Configuration

Every `.ts`/`.tsx` file in the repository must be covered by a tsconfig that `tsc --build` reaches. No file may exist in a type-checking blind spot.

- **Test files must be type-checked.** Each package has a `tsconfig.test.json` that includes `src/**/*.test.ts`.
- **Build scripts must be type-checked.** Standalone scripts (e.g., `build-*.ts`) that live outside `src/` have their own tsconfig.
- **Root config files must be type-checked.** Files like `knip.ts` and `playwright.config.ts` are covered by `tsconfig.configs.json`.
- **Never exclude files from type-checking to avoid fixing type errors.** If a file has type errors, fix the errors.
- **When adding a new `.ts` file**, verify it is covered by an existing tsconfig.

### Verification

Once a task is complete, **always run every one of these checks** to verify the change:

```bash
npm run build         # Verify production build
npm run type-check    # TypeScript check (must pass from clean checkout)
npm run lint          # Check for lint errors
npm run knip          # Check for unused code
npm run test          # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # E2E tests (Playwright)

**Every command must exit 0.** A task is not done until all six pass. No exceptions.

For full repository verification including docs and plugins, use `npm run check:everything`.

- If a check fails, **fix it** — even if the failure looks pre-existing or unrelated to your change. You own the codebase.
- Do not rationalize failures ("that's a known issue", "the build is the real type-check", "this was broken before I started"). If it fails, it is your problem. Fix it or explain to the user why you cannot.
- Do not skip a check because a different check covers "the same thing". Each command tests something distinct. Run all of them.

### Biome

- **NEVER use `biome-ignore` comments** in source code to suppress lint errors. Always fix the underlying issue.
- **NEVER add file-specific rule overrides in biome.json** to suppress lint errors. Always fix the source code instead.
- If a rule violation occurs, investigate and fix the root cause.
- If a dependency uses deprecated APIs, update the code to use the recommended alternative.

### Code Style

- Follow all configured Biome lint rules.

### Runtime Compatibility

All packages run on **Node.js 22+**. The monorepo uses **npm** workspaces for dependency management and **npm** for registry authentication and publishing.

**Production code** (`platform/*/src/`): Uses Node.js APIs directly (`node:fs/promises`, `node:child_process`, `node:crypto`, `process.env`, `process.argv`).

**Build scripts** (`build-*.ts`, `scripts/`): Use esbuild for bundling. Invoked via `npm run` or `npx tsx`. These are contributor-only and do not need to run in production.

**Tests** (`*.test.ts`): Use Vitest. Contributor-only — normal users and plugin developers do not run platform tests.

**E2E tests** (`e2e/`) run under Playwright's Node.js test runner.

### Comments

Comments should describe **current behavior**, not historical context. Write comments that state facts about what the code does now.

**Avoid:**

- Comments explaining what code "used to do" or "was changed from"
- Negative phrasing like "we don't do X" or "don't touch Y"
- Historical markers like "previously", "legacy", "deprecated", "removed"
- Comments that only make sense if you know what the code looked like before

**Prefer:**

- Factual descriptions of current behavior
- Explanations of why current code works the way it does
- Technical rationale for design decisions

## Keeping AGENTS.md Up to Date

**Important**: This file should remain **plugin-agnostic**. Do not enumerate individual plugins or tools by name. The codebase grows by adding new plugins — documentation should describe patterns and conventions, not inventories.

Guidelines for updates:

- Keep additions **high-level** — avoid excessive detail that wastes context
- Focus on **architecture, patterns, and conventions** — not per-plugin details
- **Never list individual plugins** (e.g. "Slack, Datadog, ...") — use generic terms like "plugins" and reference the code structure for discovery
- Remove outdated information that no longer applies
- **Package-specific details belong in that package's AGENTS.md** — not here

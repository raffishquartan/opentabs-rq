/**
 * Bundle the background service worker and offscreen document.
 *
 * Chrome extension module service workers cannot resolve bare module specifiers
 * (e.g., '@opentabs-dev/shared'). The tsc build emits these as-is, so a
 * bundling step is needed to resolve them into self-contained files.
 *
 * Runs AFTER tsc (which produces dist/ with type-checked JS) and BEFORE the
 * extension is loaded into Chrome. Each entry point is bundled into its
 * original dist/ location, overwriting the tsc output.
